- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket-based live updates
- **Export Capabilities**: PDF reports, CSV data export

## Technical Choices Analysis

### Backend Technology Stack
**Recommended: Node.js with Express.js**
- **Rationale**: 
  - Excellent ecosystem for API development
  - Strong community support
  - Easy integration with various CI/CD platforms
  - Real-time capabilities with Socket.io
  - Rich npm ecosystem for integrations

### Frontend Technology Stack
**Recommended: React with TypeScript**
- **Rationale**:
  - Component-based architecture for reusable UI elements
  - Strong typing for better code quality
  - Rich ecosystem for charts and dashboards
  - Excellent state management options
  - Mobile-responsive design capabilities

### Database Technology
**Recommended: PostgreSQL with Redis**
- **Rationale**:
  - PostgreSQL for structured data (pipelines, builds, users)
  - Redis for caching and real-time data
  - ACID compliance for critical data
  - JSON support for flexible schema
  - Excellent performance for read-heavy workloads

### Containerization
**Recommended: Docker with Docker Compose**
- **Rationale**:
  - Consistent deployment across environments
  - Easy scaling and orchestration
  - Simplified dependency management
  - Industry standard for containerization

## APIs and Tools Required

### External APIs
1. **CI/CD Platform APIs**:
   - GitHub Actions API
   - GitLab CI API
   - Jenkins REST API
   - Azure DevOps API

2. **Notification Services**:
   - Slack Webhook API (implemented)
   - Email via SMTP (implemented)
   - Microsoft Teams Webhook (roadmap)
   - SMS service (Twilio) (roadmap)

3. **Monitoring & Analytics** (roadmap):
   - Prometheus for metrics collection
   - Grafana for advanced visualization
   - ELK Stack for logging

### Development Tools
1. **Version Control**: Git with GitHub
2. **Package Management**: npm/yarn for Node.js
3. **Testing**: Jest for backend, React Testing Library for frontend
4. **Code Quality**: ESLint, Prettier, Husky
5. **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for the dashboard itself

## Security Requirements
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
- **API Security**: Rate limiting, input validation
- **Data Encryption**: HTTPS, database encryption
- **Audit Logging**: Track all user actions and system events

## Performance Requirements
- **Response Time**: < 2 seconds for dashboard load
- **Real-time Updates**: < 1 second for live data
- **Scalability**: Support for 100+ concurrent users
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime
- **Data Retention**: 1 year of historical data

## Assumptions
1. **User Base**: Small to medium development teams (10-100 users)
2. **Pipeline Volume**: Moderate number of pipelines (10-50 active)
3. **Integration Scope**: Focus on major CI/CD platforms initially
4. **Deployment**: Cloud-based deployment (AWS/Azure/GCP)
5. **Budget**: Open-source tools and reasonable cloud costs

## Success Criteria
1. **User Adoption**: 80% of team members use dashboard daily
2. **Alert Effectiveness**: 90% of critical issues detected within 5 minutes
3. **Performance**: Dashboard loads in under 2 seconds
4. **Reliability**: System uptime > 99.9%
5. **Integration**: Support for at least 3 major CI/CD platforms (current: GitHub, Jenkins; roadmap: GitLab CI/Azure DevOps)

## Risk Assessment
1. **Technical Risks**:
   - API rate limits from external services
   - Real-time data synchronization challenges
   - Performance issues with large datasets

2. **Mitigation Strategies**:
   - Implement caching and rate limiting
   - Use efficient data structures and indexing
   - Implement pagination and data archiving

## Next Steps
1. Create detailed technical design document
2. Set up development environment
3. Implement core backend API
4. Build frontend dashboard
5. Integrate with CI/CD platforms
6. Implement alerting system
7. Add comprehensive testing
8. Deploy and monitor
